            It was formed at the end of the 70s in the Andean music school directed by the members of the Los Kjarkas folk group, however most of its members were trained in other academies (Colegio Eduardo Laredo). Originally they formed the group "Proyección Kjarkas"; at that time the members of the group were: Orlando Jiménez, Yuri Ortuño, (Fernando Torrico), Edwin Castellanos, Raul Muriel and Mijaíl Montaño; under the direction of the Hermosa brothers.

            In 1979 the group was officially founded in the city of Cochabamba and they published two long durations "Abierto mi Corazón" and "Mis Penas". After a change in its members, in 1984 they changed their name to "Proyección" (A secas) in the city of La Paz; the members in this stage were:
            
            Yuri Ortuño, in the first voice
            Orlando Jiménez, in the direction
            Rafael Arias Paz, on guitar (First Folkloric guitar)
            Raúl Muriel Hinojosa, in the wind instruments
            
            Subsequently, they became known as "Projection - The New Expression of Bolivian Folklore", this from August 1986. His first musical production was "I do not love again", recorded in 1984, giving rise to his first international successes. In their more than 25 years of existence they have been winners of the Gold Disc, Platinum Disc, Silver Pitcher and other more awards (Illustrious Guests from the city of Tarma, Peru). Several of his hits have been recorded by other artists: «Secreto Amor» by the rock group Jade and Argentine groups; "Sambos de Corazón" by the Tekis from Argentina, "Paloma del Alma Mía" by the female techno-cumbiero group Agua Bella from Peru.
            
            The rhythms performed by the group are very diverse, ranging from Bolivian folk rhythms to folk rhythms from other Latin American countries. Starting in 1994 on the occasion of the Soccer World Cup of that year, they are invited to the United States on a tour for the Bolivian community that that year had the honor of having their National Team participate in the event; from that moment the doors of the rest of the world were opened to them: Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Sweden.
            
            At the end of the 90s, its leader, vocalist and one of its founders, Yuri Ortuño León, definitively separated from the group and was replaced by Boris Flores Crespo, who was invited by Ariel Villazón and Orlando Jimenez. From that moment on, the group begins a gradual restructuring that allows it to achieve new successes, forming a solid and consolidated group prepared for new challenges. The current members have been unchanged for more than 14 years, only the members of the back round (support) have changed; among them Gonzalo Arispe (bass), Rolando Cahuana (Bass), Sergio Rodriguez (Bass) and Adalid Espinoza (Latin Percussion).
            
            In 2012 they plan to release their new album "More reasons to follow", of which the first two tracks are already being promoted: "Mi Candor" (song) and "LLegará" (tuff).
            
            And in 2013 they arrive in the month of July for various presentations nationwide, introducing us to the new production that contains 14 songs with very varied rhythms.
